## Browser Compatibility
Browser compatibility testing was completed with Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera, running on a MacBook. Edge and IE were not tested at this stage due to lack of access to those browsers. Before professional site deployment, compatibility would need to be tested on Windows-specific and a selection of mobile-specific browsers.

*Table 1: Browser responsiveness test results*

| | CHROME | FIREFOX | SAFARI | OPERA | Notes | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| Intended appearance? | Good | Good | Good | Good | No issues identified |
| Intended responsiveness? | Good | Good | Good | Good | No issues identified |

Results of the testing undertaken on each browser can also be seen in the following folders: [Chrome](browsers/chrome/), [Firefox](browsers/firefox/), [Safari](browsers/safari/), [Opera](browsers/opera/).

## Site Responsiveness
Responsiveness tests were undertaken using Google Chrome DevTools and the online tools [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) and [AmIResponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive). All tests were conducted using a MacBook. 
Due to lack of access to multiple devices, all device responsiveness tests were completed using the [Google Chrome DevTools simulation tool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/). Before professional site deployment, responsiveness would need to be tested on real devices.

This project was deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The instructions to achieve this are below:

On your local machine:
1. Open a command line/terminal window within the main project folder. 
2. Create a requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` at the command line. 
3. Create a Procfile by typing `echo web: python app.py > Procfile` 
4. Add and commit these files to Github.

Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Log in or create an account
1. Click the 'New' button and click 'Create new app'.
2. Enter a unique name for your project with no capital letters or spaces and select the region closest to you (e.g., Europe). Click 'Create App'.
3. Inside the dashboard for your new app, go to the 'Settings' tab. 
4. Scroll down and click 'Reveal Config Vars' then enter data for the following variables:
